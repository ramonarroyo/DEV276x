## Module Project - Trip Planner
This project is a program that asks the user for some information about an international trip they are taking. Based on that information there are some conversions, using the correct data types, to tell them some information to help them plan their trip.

## Module Project - Odds or Evens
This project is a game called "Odds and Evens". The game is similar to rock, paper, scissors. It is played between two players, in this version being you versus the computer. Each player will choose either "odds" or "evens", since you’re playing the computer you will get first pick. Once you have chosen your side, you each choose a number of fingers to play- 0 to 5. The winner is determined by whether the sum of your fingers is odd or even (depending on what you chose).

## Module Project - Crypto
This project encrypts text using the Caesar cipher, an ecryption algorithm that shifts each individual character forward (or backwards) by a certain number or key. The code is then separated into groups of your desired amount of letters per group.

## Final Project - Maze Runner
This project is a game that lets the player navigate a maze. You play by entering in which direction you would like to move and try to find your way to the end in less than 100 moves!
