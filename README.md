## Module Project - Trip Planner
This project is a program that asks the user for some information about an international trip they are taking. Based on that information there are some conversions, using the correct data types, to tell them some information to help them plan their trip.

## Module Project - Odds or Evens
This project is a game called "Odds and Evens". The game is similar to rock, paper, scissors. It is played between two players, in this version being you versus the computer. Each player will choose either "odds" or "evens", since you’re playing the computer you will get first pick. Once you have chosen your side, you each choose a number of fingers to play- 0 to 5. The winner is determined by whether the sum of your fingers is odd or even (depending on what you chose).
