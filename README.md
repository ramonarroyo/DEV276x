# Microsoft DEV276x: Learn to Program in Java

## Module Project - Trip Planner
For this project, you are going to write a program that asks the user for some information about an international trip they are taking. Based on that information you will need to do some conversions, using the correct data types, to tell them some information to help them plan their trip.

## Module 2 Project - Odds or Evens
For this project you are going to program a game called "Odds and Evens". The game is similar to rock paper scissors. It is played between two players, in your version it will be you versus the computer. Each player will choose either "odds" or "evens", since you’re playing the computer you will get first pick. Once you have chosen your side, you each choose a number of fingers to play- 0 to 5. The winner is determined by whether the sum of your fingers is odd or even (depending on what you chose).
